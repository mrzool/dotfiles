Config files for my \*nix systems.

I'm a creature of habit and like my software to be stable and predictable. I'm very conservative when it comes to updating things and it's unlikely my configuration will change substantially in the future.

- **OS**: Mac OS X 10.11 "El Capitan"
- **Terminal**: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
- **Color scheme**: [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) in the Dark Ocean variant
- **Font**: [Input Mono](http://input.fontbureau.com/) by [Font Bureau](http://www.fontbureau.com/) (since 2014, the year of release)
- **Desktop wallpaper**: [Flavoured](http://digitalshiva.deviantart.com/art/Flavoured-121784194) by Tkui (my only wallpaper since 2009!)

By the way, my computer is a late-2009, white polycarbonate unibody MacBook (A1342) that looks like [this](http://mrzool.cc/assets/imgs/macbook-A1342.jpeg) and which I'm very fond of. After SSD, RAM and battery upgrade, its GeekBench score reached 2365, which puts it approximately on par with a late-2011 MacBook Pro or a mid-2013 MacBook Air. That's more than enough for my needs and I don't plan to buy a new machine anytime soon.

This repository includes dotfiles for Bash, Readline, Vim, tmux, Git, Mutt, newsbeuter, mpd/ncmpcpp, and more.

Managed with the [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) utility (read more about it [here](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html)).
