zool's dotfiles for Linux
=========================

Personal configuration files for Linux.  I mostly use a combination of bash, vim and git in my daily work.

My main machine is a tweaked Thinkpad x100e running [Crunchbang](http://crunchbang.org/), a nimble and infinitely hackable Debian-based Linux distro. It's fast. 

This is how it looks:

Tools of the trade
------------------

This repo includes dotfiles for:

- bash
- git
- vim
- openbox
- terminator
- compton
- conky
- mr
- mutt
- tint2
- xmodmap
- xxkb


Notes
-----

The bash script for symlinking is buggy and unmaintained, run it at your own risk.
